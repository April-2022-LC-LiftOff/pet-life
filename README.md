# Description
  
Hello pet lovers! This project is about an animal tracker called PetLife. PetLife is your pet/animal virtual organizer, which allows pet owners and veterinarians to share information with each other.  

Pet owner users can log in to create a profile of their pets. 
With the account, they can insert their pet's information covering from biographical to medical, like name, sex, behaviors, species, allergies, vaccines, surgeries, etc.

Veterinarians users can create veterinarian profile by selecting veterinarian view that gives access to all pet information in the database.

Thanks to the features described above, owners and veterinarians can seamlessly collaborate and communicate with each other via the application. They never need to deal with scattered information about their beloved animals. All information is in one place in the database. One account can do anything!

This application is inspired by all pet lovers and their needs. We are designing an application that can serve as a hassle-free communication service between pet owners and pet caretakers to bring the best benefits for human and animals.
